## Introduction

GRCh38/hg38 is the assembly of the human genome released December of 2013, that uses alternate or ALT contigs to represent common complex variation, including ALT contigs to represent common complex variation, including HLA loci. Alternate contigs, alternate scaffolds or alternate loci allow for representation of diverging haplotypes. These regions are too complex for a single representation. Identify ALT contigs by their _alt suffix. The GRCh38 ALT contigs total 109Mb in length and span 60Mb of the primary assembly. Alternate contig sequences can be novel to highly diverged or nearly identical to corresponding primary assembly sequence. Sequences that are highly diverged from the primary assembly only contribute a few million bases. Most subsequences of ALT contigs are fairly similar to the primary assembly (reference: https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360041155232-Reference-Genome-Components). In this analysis, we are interested in looking at the coverage of ALT regions on chromosome in our WGS normal samples. 

## Data

The WGS alignment files for normal samples used in calculating coverage exist in GDS. The location of this data is:

mosdepth was used to calculate mean per-region given a [BED file](./Alt_contigs_hg38_sorted.bed) of regions. The result is summarized below.



```r
# read in bed file with regions of interest
bed_coverage <- as.data.frame(read.table("/Users/kanwals/UMCCR/git/sk-explore/coverage_alts/Alt_contigs_hg38_sorted.bed", header = FALSE, sep="\t", stringsAsFactors=FALSE))
colnames(bed_coverage) <- c("chr", "region_start", "region_end")

# list files in the input directory - made using mosdepth
list_of_files <- list.files(path = params$mosdepth_output,
                            recursive = TRUE,
                            pattern = "\\.bed.gz$",
                            full.names = TRUE)

for (i in 1:length(list_of_files)){
  # read files and prepare data format for display
  file <- read_tsv(list_of_files[i],col_names = c("chr", "region_start", "region_end", "mean_coverage" ),col_types = "cn") %>%
      mutate(sample_id = basename(list_of_files[i])) %>%
      mutate(sample_id = gsub("*_normal.regions.bed.gz", "", sample_id)) 
  # find sample id and rename mean_coverage column using it
  sample_name <- unique(file$sample_id)
  sample_coverage <- file %>%
    dplyr::rename(!!sample_name := mean_coverage) %>%
    dplyr::select(one_of(sample_name))
  # add sample_coverage to original bed file
  bed_coverage <- cbind(bed_coverage, sample_coverage)
}

mean_cov_across_samples = round(rowMeans(bed_coverage[,c(5:ncol(bed_coverage))]), 2)
bed_coverage <- add_column(bed_coverage, mean_cov_across_samples, .after = 3)
```

## Plot results

We are interested to check what regions consistently have less than X coverage (say less than 500x in 90% of the samples). On the basis of this information, we might consider dropping them from the assay. 



```r
# plot results - violin plot
bed_coverage %>%
  dplyr::select(mean_cov_across_samples) %>%
  gather(key="Samples", value="Mean_Coverage") %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=Samples, y=Mean_Coverage)) +
  geom_violin(trim=FALSE, fill="grey") + 
  geom_dotplot(binaxis= "y",
               stackdir = "center",
               dotsize = 0.5,
               fill = 1) +
  theme_apa()
```
